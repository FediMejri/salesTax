### salesTax
The sales Tax problem solution written with java using maven for build and Junit for tests . This is a coding challenge.

### The problem description

Basic sales tax is applicable at a rate of 10% on all goods, except books, food, and medical
products that are exempt. Import duty is an additional sales tax
applicable on all imported goods at a rate of 5%, with no exemptions. When I purchase items
I receive a receipt which lists the name of all the items and their price (including tax),
finishing with the total cost of the items,
and the total amounts of sales taxes paid. The rounding rules for sales tax are that for a tax
rate of n%, a shelf price of p contains (np/100 rounded up to the nearest 0.05) amount of
sales tax.
